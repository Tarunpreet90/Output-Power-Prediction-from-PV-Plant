# Output-Power-Prediction-from-PV-Plant
This Python code preprocesses time series data related to solar energy parameters and output power, applies scaling, and splits the dataset into training and testing sets. It then builds and trains an LSTM model to predict output power. The model architecture includes two LSTM layers and dense layers. Early stopping is used to prevent overfitting. The code also utilizes XGBoost for comparison. The performance of both models is evaluated using regression metrics such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error, root mean square error, and R2 score. The final section compares the performance of the LSTM model and the XGBoost model in terms of these metrics, providing insights into the effectiveness of each approach.
